## Language

- **YOU MUST write everything that lands on disk in English** — files, folder names, commit
  messages, code comments, documentation, PR and issue text. Read any language, write English.
- **Answer in the language the user writes in** — the chat only; every file you write is English.
- **Explain simply, in bullets.** Short, common words and one idea per sentence — write as if the
  reader is smart but new to the topic. Say the consequence first, then the thing.
- **Never invent a word for something.** No metaphors of your own making, no house vocabulary,
  no shorthand borrowed from this repository's files. Use the ordinary word, even if it is
  longer. A term the reader has not met needs its meaning in the same sentence, every time —
  not the first time only. Default to bullets and small tables over prose.
- The product's user-facing copy may be in any language; everything internal is English.

## How you close a response

**Every response ends with a summary block. Nothing comes after it**, so the user never scrolls
up to find out what happened.

- **Heading and contents in the language you are answering in.**
- Point-by-point, scannable. No prose paragraphs.
- When something changed, include a two-column before/after table.
- Assumptions and open questions go inside this block, not scattered through the answer.

## How you operate

- **Ask about the what and the how; decide only the trivial.** Where there is a real choice —
  what to build, or the approach, structure, or library for it — say plainly what you mean to do,
  then ask first: a few short multiple-choice questions, up front, and the same at each plan and
  each real change; defining it through questions is faster and builds better. Decide silently
  only what has no real alternative — formatting, an obvious name — then note it and report it.
  Always stop for destructive or irreversible operations, real money, or production.
- **Batch, never interrupt.** One upfront batch or a checkpoint, never scattered
  mid-task; anything you did not ask, you decided — record it in the closing summary.
- **Reach for subagents on purpose.** Before a broad search, a sweep across many files, or two
  jobs that do not depend on each other, ask which agent fits and dispatch it — in parallel where
  they share no state. Name the agent and the skill it should run, in one line, then send it.
  Waiting to be asked is the failure; a single known file is the only case that stays inline.
- **Look backwards only when you are the one starting.** Deciding yourself to change existing
  code? First find out why it is the way it is — `git log -S` on the line, and the rule in
  `CONVENTIONS.md` if one covers it. Asked directly for something? Build it; do not go digging
  for why it was once done differently.

## Rules

- **`CONVENTIONS.md` holds the rules that apply now.** It is the only binding source, and it is
  a living file: a rule is rewritten or deleted the moment it stops being true. There is no
  archive of past rules, and nothing outside this file may be quoted as binding.
- **A request outranks a rule.** Where the request departs from one, say so in one sentence —
  *this departs from R-STRUCT-001* — and then carry it out. No investigation, no alternatives.
- **Past reasoning lives in git.** `git log -p CONVENTIONS.md` shows when a rule changed and why.
  That is the whole history mechanism, and it is deliberately not in the read path.
- **If the new approach becomes the norm, update the rule** at the end, in the summary.
- **A rule the code structurally ignores is a bug in one of the two.** Never decide which alone:
  add it to `## Open` in `STATE.md`.

## Memory system

This repo keeps its own memory. **IMPORTANT: you maintain it as part of doing the work.**

| Trigger | Action |
|---|---|
| User reacts, criticises, or states a preference | Use the `record-rule` workflow before acting |
| A real choice is made, or a norm needs writing down | Use the `record-rule` workflow |
| A rule stops being true | Rewrite it or delete it. Never leave it standing as history |
| A user-visible change ships | An entry in the changelog naming what is different for the reader — and refresh any outward-facing text it makes stale: README opening, repository description and topics. Outward text is derived from what is already public, never from `STATE.md` or a brief. A project that ships no user-visible releases has no changelog, and that is correct — do not create one |
| Session starts on an existing project | Run `catch-up` — `STATE.md` here, then every sibling worktree's, then unmerged branches |
| Session ends | Run `handoff`, unannounced. A sibling workspace can only read what you wrote down |
| A build or code change is complete | Run `scripts/verify.sh`, then `build-quality` |

**Definition of Done:** `scripts/verify.sh` exits 0 + changelog entry if user-visible + a rule
written, updated or deleted where the work settled one + `STATE.md` updated + a `build-quality`
report for this project's platform, where every domain carries evidence or is reported
`not measured` + every written artefact in English + a closing summary block listing the
assumptions.

**A `pass` without evidence is not a pass.** Report `not measured` instead and say what would
have produced the evidence. A task without a memory write is not done.

**`Visibility` decides how freely memory is written.** Where it is `private`, write bluntly.
Where it is `public` or `may become public`, write nothing you would not publish on this
project's own website — git history is public the moment the repository is, so there is no
later redaction. Record the shape instead: *the budget ceiling was reached*, not the figure.

## Rules that are easy to get wrong

- A rule carries one sentence of *why*. If the why does not fit in one sentence, the rule is wrong.
- Never invent a reason. Where the evidence is silent, write `Why: unknown` and leave it there.
- Creating new shared files is fine; **editing an existing shared file is the one case
  where you flag it first**, because a parallel worktree is probably editing it too.
- Before choosing a skill, an agent, a library, or an MCP, read
  `~/.local/share/dev-standards/references/`: `skill-routing.md` says which skills a request
  should wake and `standard-agents.md` names the agents you may send, plus libraries and MCPs.
- On React or Tailwind work, search Untitled UI (MCP) before writing a component or icon; Context7 if it is down.

# cardorb-web

A trading card management web app — browse, organize, and manage trading card
collections. Built on Next.js (App Router) with Untitled UI React components.

- Profile: prototype
- Platform: web
- Stage: experiment
- Users: none yet
- Visibility: private

`Platform` decides which quality domains `build-quality` applies and which baseline it reads.
`Visibility` decides how freely the memory system may write; when it cannot be determined it is
`may become public`, because a repository's visibility is usually decided later, by someone who
was not there when the rules were written. Neither is decoration.

## Commands

- Verify everything: `./scripts/verify.sh` ← the one an agent should reach for
- Install: `pnpm install`
- Dev: `pnpm dev` (Next.js + Turbopack, http://localhost:3000)
- Build: `pnpm build`
- Test: none yet — no test runner set up.
- Lint: `pnpm lint` (Prettier check); `pnpm format` to fix
- Typecheck: `pnpm typecheck` (`tsc --noEmit`)

## Architecture

- `src/app/` — Next.js App Router routes, layouts, pages
- `src/components/` — Untitled UI React components (base / application / marketing / shared-assets / foundations)
- `src/hooks/`, `src/providers/`, `src/utils/` — shared hooks, context providers, helpers (`cx`, etc.)
- `src/styles/` — `globals.css`, `theme.css` (Untitled UI design tokens), `typography.css`
- Card data + auth: planned via Supabase (not wired yet).

(3–6 lines maximum. Point at files; do not describe them.)

## Product-specific rules

They live in `CONVENTIONS.md`, numbered and with their enforcement stated. Do not repeat them
here — one list, one place.

## Where things live

- Rules that apply now: @CONVENTIONS.md — the only binding source, and the whole of it.
- Current state: @STATE.md
- Why a rule reads the way it does: `git log -p CONVENTIONS.md`. There is no archive.
